-   The `java.io` package provides byte and character streams, through the abstract classes `InputStream` and `OutputStream` for byte streams, and `Reader` and `Writer` for character streams.
-   The streams provided for file handling are `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `FileReader`, and `FileWriter`.
-   The `System` class has the standard streams: `in`, which implements `InputStream`; `out`, and `err`, which implement `PrintStream`. Since the standard streams are byte-based, they must be wrapped around character-based streams to be used with characters. The methods from 'PrintStream' convert bytes to characters, so wrapping is not _required_ for them, although recommended.

```java
// Wrapping a BufferedReader around System.in
Console console = System.console();
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in, console.charset()));

// Reading a char and a String from the BufferedReader
br.read();
br.readLine();

// Wrapping a PrintWriter around System.out (or System.err)
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);

// Opening, writing to, and closing a file prior to JDK 7
FileWriter file = new FileWriter("")
file.write("Paçoca é bão");
file.close();

// Opening, writing to, and closing a file using try-with-resources. THis syntax
// is valid for resources that implement the AutoCloseable interface.
try (FileWriter file = new FileWriter("")) {
    file.write("Lasanha também é bão");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.print("An exception occurred")e
}
```
