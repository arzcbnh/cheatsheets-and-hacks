title: Well-known and custom symbols
---

Using symbols, it is possible to create complex interfaces for object and non-colliding prototype extensions. Some symbols are already used by JavaScript for custom behavior, and they're called **well-known symbols**. Those symbols are accessible as static properties of the `Symbol` constructor.

A list of well-known symbols can be found at [the page for Symbol on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#static_properties).

### Extending prototypes

Sometimes, there'd be value in implementing a method for a type, but extending prototypes are a bad practice because they lead to collisions and unmaintainable code. A method can be safely implemented with the help of symbols.

```js
const newMethod = Symbol();

String.prototype[newMethod] = function () {
    // ...
};

const str = "Some text";
str[newMethod]();
```

### `Symbol.iterator`

The `Symbol.iterator` is checked for in many constructs that implement the iterator protocol, such as the spread operator and `for` loops. Its expected to hold an iterator function for the object.

```js
const iterable1 = {};

iterable1[Symbol.iterator] = function* () {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
};

console.log(...iterable1); // -> 1 2 3
```
